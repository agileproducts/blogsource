I've been listening to a great little series on R4 called [Zeitgeisters](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02zbyxh) which was about “cultural entrepreneurs who are shaping our lives". I thought it could equally well have be billed as being about disruptive online businesses. 

The episodes about [YouTube](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0366wms) and [Coursera](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b036j3qc) were classic stories about the new challengers, whereas the episode about [Martin Mills’ music group](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02xxvbz) which runs the *Beggars Banquet* label and *Rough Trade* record stores was more about how a traditional business can survive the online revolution. 

Random bits that stuck in my head were:

* Coursera's use of a peer-grading system which incentives users to crowdsource an otherwise unmanageable task
* Their evolution of a business model based around certifying course graduates' identity - which involves something called 'keystroke biometrics'
* 100 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute - the equivalent every nine days of the BBC's entire output over 90 years
* YouTube isn't a replacement for traditional broadcasting  - it’s something different, and established broadcasters can use it
* [*Rough Trade* ](http://www.roughtrade.com/) shops aren't just selling music, they're selling an experience, the feeling of being part of the Indie music community
* A retail business involves guessing what people will like next - it's similar to DJing!
* Martin Mills' leadership style - to trust his staff to act independently, but pick them up on the little details that will help them learn
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) founder Daphne Koller's description of the alternative to engaging with disruptive online challengers - the 'ostrich strategy'
* Go to [Rhino Records](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SIjAbvCHKI)

Well worth a listen.
