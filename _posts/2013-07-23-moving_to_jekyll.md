summary: Moving my blog over from Scanty to Jekyll
---

When I started the world's most infrequently updated blog I [chose to use Adam Wiggins' scanty framework as a base](/past/2011/10/02/a_scanty_blog/). My main motivation was really just to build a site using ruby, which I'd just started learning. It's been a decent choice, and I enjoyed working with it, but it's now time to move on.

I've been increasingly attracted to hacker's favourite [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which builds a blog into a static site that can be deployed on github pages. I used it for a project at work, loved it, and have decided to port this across. For the moment I've lost a few things, such as my cool [tag cloud](past/2012/04/06/a_taglist_for_my_scanty_blog/). But I've gained something that's easier to manage and update, and I'm having fun with it, which after all is kind-of the point.
