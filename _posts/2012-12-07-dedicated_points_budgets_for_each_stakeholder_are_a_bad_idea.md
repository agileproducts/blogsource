*Having a hypothecated points budget for each stakeholder in a project leads to poor prioritisation and a fragmented delivery. Squabbling stakeholders should be convinced with quantitative evidence rather than appeased with salami-slicing, and simply over-ruled if all else fails.*

For our current (thankfully short) release cycle we’ve taken the decision to let each stakeholder - sales, marketing, editorial, etc - have their own points budget from our overall total. This happened for a variety of reasons - velocity isn’t great, there’s an awful lot of stuff sitting in the backlog, different people have been waiting a long time for features they are passionate about. In the end this was an easy way to appease people.

But it’s a mistake. Individual parts of their organisation may be getting a few cherished issues addressed, but when you look at the overall backlog the prioritisation makes no sense at all. Things of marginal overall business value are getting done before things which represent a much bigger slice of the overall business. The release feels random and disjointed with no clear objective. Pretty-much *everybody* in the team feels it was a bad idea.

So what should we do next time? We clearly need to get back to having a stronger central direction, and in the context of a limited budget that will inevitably mean telling some stakeholders that their priorities aren’t our priorities. That’s a difficult message, but it should be easier to swallow if we assemble some quantitative evidence to back it up. How much revenue do the different sales channels represent? What do our analytics tell us about the relative importance of different features? How much time are we currently spending on support, what does that cost, and how much might certain stories reduce that by? If we can put some real numbers on the different parts of the backlog we ought to be able to get better agreement on priorities.

Try to please everybody, and you end up pleasing nobody.
